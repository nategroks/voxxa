# Project Status

## Project: Voxxa — voice-following slide advancer for churches
**Current Phase:** Re-planning after discovery of the May implementation branch — ADR-010 Proposed; next session runs prompt Q0 from `specs/2026-11-11-prompts-10x-team.md`
**Last Updated:** 2026-11-11 by 10x-team orchestrator
**Health:** On Track

## Progress

### Done
- [x] Discovery Protocol; `[DISCOVERED]` decisions for CTO, Architect, Staff Engineer, DevOps, SDE
- [x] Deep research, 5 angles, confidence-rated: `specs/2026-10-24-research-report.md`
- [x] User research plan: `specs/2026-10-24-user-research-plan.md`
- [x] Phase 1 Strategy: `specs/2026-10-24-business-strategy.md`; `decisions/cto/`, `decisions/product-manager/`
- [x] Phase 2 Design: `specs/2026-10-24-software-strategy.md`; ADR-001…009; `decisions/architect/`, `decisions/staff-engineer/`
- [x] Phase 3 Planning: `specs/2026-10-24-delivery-plan-and-prompts.md`; `decisions/engineering-manager/`, `decisions/senior-engineer/`

- [x] User approved specs and ADR-001…009 (Accepted); GPL confirmed; US LLC confirmed; pilot church #1: The Lighthouse, Midlothian
- [x] Increment 0: P0.1 positioning, P0.2 dead weight + licence + deny, P0.3 CI (`decisions/sde/church-autoadvance.md`)

- [x] CI green on all five jobs (ubuntu/windows/macos fmt+clippy+test, cargo deny, line budgets) at d976698 on PR nategroks/voxxa#1; one real defect found and fixed on the way (icon.ico/icon.icns were PNGs)

- [x] 2026-11-11 Discovery of `origin/claude/affectionate-lamport-8al8B` (44 commits, May 2026, never merged): presenter drivers, importers, Planning Center, conductor, VAD, HTTP API, Flatpak. Notes in role indexes; ADR-010 Proposed; prompt pack regenerated for `/10x-Team:10x-team`.

- [x] 2026-11-11 PR #1 cargo deny went red on nine newly published advisories; fixed by openssl 0.10.82 and moving the tauri family to 2.12.5 (updater 2.14.1 → zip 9, rust-version 1.90, zip ignores deleted). CI green on f177fbe.

### In Progress
- [ ] User: approve ADR-010 (via prompt Q0 or directly); PR #1 still open as a draft, CI green, unmerged

### Pending
- [ ] Q0 discovery/approval → Q1 merge + CI bar → Q2 verification → Increment 1′ (Q3–Q7) … per the 2026-11-11 prompt pack
- [ ] Founder: record two PD-hymn fixtures; apply to SignPath; open Partner Center; e-mail CCLI; form LLC; start research screener
- [ ] Phases 4–6 per increment

### Blocked
(none)

## Risks
- R8 Unreviewed May-branch code (its own REVIEW.md found six critical bugs in one pass) — Q2 runs QA + security before any new feature
- R9 Dependency advisories in pdf-extract/lopdf and rusqlite may force crate replacement — Q1 gates on cargo deny; PDF importer may go behind an off-by-default feature
- R1 Recognition on sung vocals (Whisper WER 21–56% on singing) — mitigated by ADR-009 + eval harness in Inc 1; kill criterion week 14
- R2 Support conversion ≈ 1% — Setup & Calibration + Store listing as independent lines; decision gate month 12
- R3 CCLI/publisher objection to lyric indexing — no lyrics shipped; written question before launch
- R4 Vendors ship lyric-following natively — ship first on open platforms; contribute upstream
- R5 SmartScreen friction — Store listing + SignPath/Trusted Signing + winget
- R6 Founder on-call load — bounded Sunday window; MSP partners carry their churches
- R7 Windows-first vs Mac churches — unsigned previews; ADR-002 review trigger
